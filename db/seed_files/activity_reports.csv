I discussed with Godrej Regarding this requirement. They have cleared that battery operated trolleys are not safety compliant for Zone 2 Application.

They have suggested Diesel Operated Fork Lift to be 100% safe. It will cost around 9 Lakhs. It comes in minimum 2 Tons Weight handling capacity.
Also, It requires a starter. There are 2 Types :- a Electric Starter ( Approx 65000 INR)  b Hydraulic Starter ( Approx 6 Lakhs INR )

The problem with electric starter is that it is installed in a fixed place. So once the vehicle is started , it should remain On if it is away from the starter. Reason is that the vehicle weighs around 6-8 Tons and it is not possible to pull it, as it is very heavy.","Have provided this information to vinit and dipali.
