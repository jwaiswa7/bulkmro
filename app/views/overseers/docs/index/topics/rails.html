Rails use the same naming convention as Ruby as follows:

# Variable
**Variable** - _e.g. order_amount, total_

Variables are named where all letters are lowercase and words are separated by underscores.

# Class and Module
**Class and Module** - _e.g. InvoiceItem_

Classes and modules use MixedCase and have no underscores, each word starts with a uppercase letter.

# Database Table
**Database Table ** - _e.g. invoice_items, orders_ Table names have all lowercase letters and underscores between words, also all table names need to be plural.


# Model
**Model** - _e.g. Order_

The model is named using the class naming convention of unbroken MixedCase and is always the singular of the table name. e.g.



*   Table name might be orders, people (plural)
*   The model name would be Order, Person (singular)
*   Rails will then look for the class definition in a file called order.rb in the /app/models directory.
*   If the model class name has multiple capitalised words, the table name is assumed to have underscores between these words.

#####Model Naming Convention


```
Table: 			orders
Class: 			Order
File: 			/app/models/order.rb
Primary Key: 		id
Foreign Key: 		customer_id
Link Tables: 		items_orders
```

# Controller
**Controller** - _e.g. OrdersController_

Controller class names are pluralized, such that OrdersController would be the controller class for the orders table. Rails will then look for the class definition in a file called orders_controller.rb in the /app/controllers directory.

#####Controller Naming Convention


```
Class: 			OrdersController
File: 			/app/controllers/orders_controller.rb
Layout: 			/app/layouts/orders.html.erb
```


#####View Naming Convention


```
Helper: 			/app/helpers/orders_helper.rb
Helper Module: 	OrdersHelper
Views: 			/app/views/orders/… (list.html.erb for example)
```

# Files, Directories and other pluralization
**Files, Directories and other pluralization**

Files are named using lowercase and underscores. Assuming we have an Orders controller then the following other conventions will apply:



*   That there is a helper module named OrdersHelper in the orders_helper.rb found in the app/helpers directory.
*   Rails will look for view template files for the controller in the app/views/orders directory.
*   Output from this view will then be used in the layout defined in the orders.html.erb in the app/views/layouts directory.
*   Test files including order_test.rb will be created in the /test/unit directory, a file will be created in the /test/fixtures directory called orders.yml and finally a file called orders_controller_test.rb will be created in the /test/functional directory

# Primary Key
**Primary Key**

The primary key of a table is assumed to be named id.

# Foreign Key
**Foreign Key**

The foreign key is named with the singular version of the target table name with _id appended to it, e.g. order_id in the items table where we have items linked to the orders table.

**Many to Many Link Tables**

Tables used to join two tables in a many to many relationship is named using the table names they link, with the table names in alphabetical order, for example items_orders.

# Variables
**Local Variables**

These should be a lowercase letter followed by other characters, naming convention states that it is better to use underscores rather than camelBack for multiple word names, e.g. mileage, variable_xyz

**Instance Variables**

Instance variables are defined using the single "at" sign (@) followed by a name. It is suggested that a lowercase letter should be used after the @, e.g. @colour

**Instance Methods**

Method names should start with a lowercase letter, and may be followed by digits, underscores, and letters, e.g. paint, close_the_door

**Class Variables**

Class variable names start with a double "at" sign (@@) and may be followed by digits, underscores, and letters, e.g. @@colour

**Constant**

Constant names start with an uppercase letter followed by other characters. Constant objects are by convention named using all uppercase letters and underscores between words, e.g. THIS_IS_A_CONSTANT

**Class and Module**

Class and module names starts with an uppercase letter, by convention they are named using MixedCase, e.g. module Encryption, class MixedCase

**Global Variables**

Starts with a dollar ($) sign followed by other characters, e.g. $global

# Comments
**Ruby Comments**

A comment hides a line, part of a line, or several lines from the Ruby interpreter. You can use the hash character (#) at the beginning of a line −


```
# I am a comment. Just ignore me.
```


Or, a comment may be on the same line after a statement or expression −


```
name = "Madisetti" # This is again comment
```


You can comment multiple lines as follows −
```
# This is a comment. \
# This is a comment, too. \
# This is a comment, too. \
# I said that already.` \
```

Here is another form. This block comment conceals several lines from the interpreter with `=begin/=end −`


```
= begin
This is a comment.
This is a comment, too.
This is a comment, too.
I said that already.
= end
```
